\begin{abstract}
  System modelling is increasingly important as a method by which we can make
  sense of the world and improve it. To model a system is to take some construct
  and build a representation of it --- but many philosophies on how this should
  be done prevail, each with their own successes and shortcomings. Aside from
  being important, systems modelling is also deeply interdisciplinary, which has
  the consequence of fracturing knowledge on the topic and effort toward it.
  Here, the current state of systems modelling across a few fields is compiled,
  and examined for their practicality in real-world systems modelling. From
  these observartions, an autopsy of the field is presented, and some avenues
  forward are suggested.

% As this stands, I think I want to make this _effectively_ the lit review for
% the PhD. It should cover lots of the literature I've read, but it should also
% contain insights (the sorts of things Tim points out that SLRs _don't_
% typically contain, that this can, because of the special issue's requirements.)

% An essay on the current state of systems modelling:
%   - The progress we've made
%   - The problems we're yet to solve
%   - Where we would ideally get to
%   - Some potential pitfalls
%     - Building something pragmatic
%     - Dealing with Tim's three inconsistencies
